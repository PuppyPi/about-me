# About me!
My personal About info, beyond what fits in the GitHub bio!  :D

# Pony Town
If you're coming from Pony Town to see this :>\\
Then I'm usually there.  Feel free to interact with me unless it says Busy.  If it says Busy feel free to whisper, but don't expect a quick response ^^

I'm often afk*ish* there, meaning I'm not looking at the screen all the time.  Please whisper if I don't respond!  (Someday maybe ponytown will get Notifications and then it can ding me if you boop or something ^w^ but until then, normal text gets lost in the scroll XD )
