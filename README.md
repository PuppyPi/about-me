My personal About info, beyond what fits in the GitHub bio!  :D

# Pony Town
If you're coming from Pony Town to see this :> then I'm usually there.<br>
Feel free to interact with me unless it says Busy.<br>
If it says Busy feel free to whisper, but don't expect a quick response ^^

I'm often afk*ish* there, meaning I'm still there, just doing laundry or soldering or something and not looking at the screen all the time. ^\_^

So please whisper if I don't respond!  (Someday maybe ponytown will get Notifications and then it can ding me if you boop or something ^w^ but until then, normal text gets lost in the "Local" tab's scroll XD so I keep the "Personal" tab open :3 )
