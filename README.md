My personal About info, beyond what fits in the GitHub bio!  :D

# Pony Town
If you're coming from Pony Town to see this :> then I'm usually there.<br>
Feel free to interact with me in any way at any time! :D<br>
If it says Away feel free to whisper, but don't expect a quick response ^^'<br>
If it says Busy feel free to whisper still, but don't expect a response at all much less a quick one ^^'<br>

I'm often afk*ish* there, meaning I'm still there, just doing laundry or soldering or something and not looking at the screen all the time. ^\_^<br>
(I'm also often not-really-afk there, meaning I'm coding or something and I'm in Pony Town but have the IDE window translucent over Pony Town and I *can* see if someone comes up to me! :D but you have no way of knowing if it's that or afkish if it says Away or Busy XD )

So tl;dr please whisper if I don't respond to boops or talking normally! (and don't get mad if I don't respond at all when Busy!)<br>
(Someday maybe ponytown will get Notifications and then it can ding me if you boop or something ^w^ but until then, normal text gets lost in the "Local" tab's scroll XD so I keep the "Personal" tab open :3 )
